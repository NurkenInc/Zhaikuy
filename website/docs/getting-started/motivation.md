# Motivation

**Zhaikuy** was made by community for community. Our main goal was to achieve **state management** tool that can be used by developers with ease, but should also be scalable, have nice developer experience, and have cheap price as bundle size, readability.

We eager to provide best solution for state management, so now we work on zhaikuy.

## Credits
Zhaikuy was inspired by [effector](https://effector.dev) and [zustand](https://zustand.dev) many best practices and core concepts were taken from this two state management tools. [Effector](https://effector.dev) was scalability inspiration and [Zustand](https://zustand.dev) as state management tool with easy codebase maintainance and cheap price.

## About
Zhaikuy provides simple **api** and nice **tools** for writing simple and maintainable codebase.

Also **Zhaikuy** was created firstly for [React UI library](https://react.dev) and now not supports libraries like vue and angular or vanilla because [Zhaikuy](https://zhaikuy.dev) was made initially like React ecosystem library. We are planning to support vanilla very soon.
